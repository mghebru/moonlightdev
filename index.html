            <h1>MOONLIGHT MUSIC SCHOOL</h1>
            <p> At Moonlight Music School in Charlotte, NC, we offer more than just private lessons in piano, violin, flute, and voice. 
                We provide a nurturing environment where your child can grow, finding joy and pride in every note and song. From the very first 
                lesson, students dive into music—playing right away while exploring notation, theory, and history. As they progress, their creativity 
                blossoms through improvisation, understanding that music is a journey of the heart and mind.<br><br></p>

          <p>My 12 year old daughter began lessons at Moonlight Music School in July of 2023. 
                      She was immediately welcomed with kindness and patience. In a short time, she’s learned
                      how to play the piano with no prior knowledge or experience in playing music. Her teacher,
                      Ms. Anna is very patient and thoughtful in her musical teaching skills. In just a few months, 
                      my daughter had the confidence to play in the recital. She truly finds joy in playing the piano and 
                      I believe that the teachers and overall experience at Moonlight Music School has played an integral role
                      in her growing passion. I would highly recommend to new or existing musical students regardless of age
                      or prior musical skills. They are also very flexible with lesson times. Thank you, Moonlight Music School!</p>

            really passionate, patient, and professional. My daughter enjoys going to music class. I also really appreciate
            how flexible they have been with scheduling the classes. I highly recommend taking music lessons at Moonlight.</p>

            additional time when needed if a concept is not understood. Highly recommend!</p>

          <p>Yekaterina is amazing! My son has been playing the piano under her teaching for the past few years. He has taken lessons 
            both at her studio and at home. We are continuously impressed at the skills he gains each week and also the confidence he 
            has gained over the years to perform in front of an audience. We would highly recommend Moonlight Music School to anyone 
            looking for a new music class.</p>

          <p>My son started classes a few months ago for the first time and I've seen improvement in his performance.
            Before, he was home trying to teach himself. Ms. Anna is a great teacher who is patient and encouraging.
            It's great to watch her teach my son and to see his confidence grow. One of the best decisions I've made this year.</p>

          <p>I've been taking my young son there for almost a year now. Ms. Katya is a fantastic teacher with great patience for new, young learners. 
                      Her teaching style is more about learning basic skills, finger positions, and music reading comprehension through songs instead of rote memorization 
                      of scales. These sessions have upped his confidence behind the keys enough to perform in a recital recently. Highly recommended to anyone.</p>

          <p>Yekaterina is cool, patient and very professional. She is currently teaching my three boys and they love her, but mainly, listen to her. My sons play a mix of 
                      Classical and Standard pieces and actually enjoy it. They have advanced so much. I can't imagine a better fit for our family. Thank You!</p>
