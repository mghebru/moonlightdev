                    <p>Owner, Piano Instructor</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aboutcontainer">
                    <p class="specialeffect">Yekaterina was born in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, near the coast of the Caspian Sea.
                         She has been involved in music since the early childhood, singing at home and in church. 
                         At the age of 7, her choir director discovered that she had perfect pitch, 
                         so she began her piano studies soon after that. As a child, 
                         Yekaterina loved to play both classical music and religious hymns. 
                         Her family moved to the United States in 2008, so she continued her musical 
                         studies in piano and choir here. Yekaterina holds a Bachelor of Arts in Piano 
                         degree from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. While at UNCC, 
                         she had a pleasure of performing for world-renowned artists, such as Benedetto 
                         Lupo and Rodney Eichenberger.  She also holds a Masters in Music with a 
                         concentration in Music Theory at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
                          Aside from teaching piano, she enjoys singing in the church choir. 
                          Yekaterina believes that music develops memory, an ability to focus and brings joy 
                          to those who can appreciate it.</p>

                <div class="aboutcontainer">
                        <p class="specialeffect">Olena Zhunda is a musician from Mariupol, Ukraine. Since she was a child, Olena has had a passion for music. 
                            She began learning to play the piano at the age of eight in music school. From 2009 to 2012, she attended a
                             music college, where she majored in piano. In 2017, Olena earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from the State
                             Pedagogical University, and went on to obtain her Master of Music Education degree, specializing in piano. 
                             After graduation, Olena continued to share her passion for music by teaching children how to play the piano 
                             in a music school and playing in an orchestra. She also taught music and rhythm basics to children at a kindergarten. 
                             Olena enjoys playing church music and working with choirs. Recently, in 2022, she moved to Monroe, NC with her family, 
                             including her husband and two daughters.</p>

                    <p class="specialeffect">Melat has been an avid musician for 13 years, playing various instruments such as the 
                        flute, piccolo, and alto flute. During her high school years, she actively participated 
                        in the school band, along with honor bands at UNCC, marching band, and served as the 
                        president of TRI-M, a music honors society. Even after high school, Melat continues to 
                        explore music in less formal settings. Melat firmly believes that music is a powerful form 
                        of self-expression and that teaching music to children can have a profound impact on their development. 
                        As an instructor, Melat ensures that each child receives personalized attention, allowing them to 
                        learn at their own pace while feeling supported throughout the process.</p>

                        Her teaching career began in Ukraine and continued in St. Petersburg, Russia. In addition to working for a 
                        music school, Anna taught private piano lessons to children and adults. Anna aspires to provide an environment 
                        for her students to happily concentrate on their musical development. Her main goal is to encourage children to
                         love music and aims to help students grasp music theory as easily and quickly as possible.
                        Anna moved to New York in 2016, and continued teaching piano lessons there. In addition, she taught group music 
                        classes to children ages 3 to 5. She always introduces children to the world of music in a lively and fun environment.

                        convinced that music lessons develop memory, attention and encourage an aesthetic perception of the world, and

              It's great to watch her teach my son and to see his confidence grow. One of the best decisions I've made this year.</p>

                        Her teaching style is more about learning basic skills, finger positions, and music reading comprehension through songs instead of rote memorization 
                        of scales. These sessions have upped his confidence behind the keys enough to perform in a recital recently. Highly recommended to anyone.</p>
