                <h1> Lessons </h1>
                <p>The lessons take place once or twice per week. In our lessons, we usually incorporate lesson books, 
                the type of which is usually determined on or shortly after the first lesson. The lesson books help 
                the student to absorb the material in a most logical way. In addition to the pieces from lesson books,
                students play scales, etudes, sonatas, and other classical pieces. Playing various types of pieces and 
                exercises allows children to explore creatively, while teaching them discipline and responsibility. In 
                addition to the wide variety of materials we utilize in our classrooms, we also have a team of dedicated and 
                professional instructors that have spent most of their lives mastering their craft and they are excited to 
                share their knowledge and expertise with your child.</p>

                <p>My daughter has been taking piano lessons at Moonlight Music School for several months. Her teacher, Anna, is 
                  really passionate, patient, and professional. My daughter enjoys going to music class. I also really appreciate
                  how flexible they have been with scheduling the classes. I highly recommend taking music lessons at Moonlight.</p>

                  additional time when needed if a concept is not understood. Highly recommend!</p>

                  has gained over the years to perform in front of an audience. We would highly recommend Moonlight Music School to anyone 
                  looking for a new music class.</p>

                  Before, he was home trying to teach himself. Ms. Anna is a great teacher who is patient and encouraging.
                  It's great to watch her teach my son and to see his confidence grow. One of the best decisions I've made this year.</p>

                <p>I've been taking my young son there for almost a year now. Ms. Katya is a fantastic teacher with great patience for new, young learners. 
                            Her teaching style is more about learning basic skills, finger positions, and music reading comprehension through songs instead of rote memorization 
                            of scales. These sessions have upped his confidence behind the keys enough to perform in a recital recently. Highly recommended to anyone.</p>
