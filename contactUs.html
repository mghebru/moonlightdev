                    <p>My daughter has been taking piano lessons at Moonlight Music School for several months. Her teacher, Anna, is 
                    really passionate, patient, and professional. My daughter enjoys going to music class. I also really appreciate
                    how flexible they have been with scheduling the classes. I highly recommend taking music lessons at Moonlight.</p>

                    <p>My daughter started piano lessons this year and has had the best experience! Yekaterina provides the perfect 
                    combination of fun and structure. You can really tell that she cares about my daughters progress and takes 
                    additional time when needed if a concept is not understood. Highly recommend!</p>

                    both at her studio and at home. We are continuously impressed at the skills he gains each week and also the confidence he 
                    has gained over the years to perform in front of an audience. We would highly recommend Moonlight Music School to anyone 
                    looking for a new music class.</p>

                    <p>My son started classes a few months ago for the first time and I've seen improvement in his performance.
                    Before, he was home trying to teach himself. Ms. Anna is a great teacher who is patient and encouraging.
                    It's great to watch her teach my son and to see his confidence grow. One of the best decisions I've made this year.</p>

                    piano and then voice lessons at this location and Ms Anna has been incredibly patient and has made a world of difference in helping 
                    my daughter grow her love for music.</p>

                    He looks forward to his lesson every week. I would highly recommend this music school to anyone looking to take piano lessons.</p>

                    <p>I've been taking my young son there for almost a year now. Ms. Katya is a fantastic teacher with great patience for new, young learners. 
                        Her teaching style is more about learning basic skills, finger positions, and music reading comprehension through songs instead of rote memorization 
                        of scales. These sessions have upped his confidence behind the keys enough to perform in a recital recently. Highly recommended to anyone.</p>

                    <p>Yekaterina is cool, patient and very professional. She is currently teaching my three boys and they love her, but mainly, listen to her. My sons play a mix of 
                        Classical and Standard pieces and actually enjoy it. They have advanced so much. I can't imagine a better fit for our family. Thank You!</p>
